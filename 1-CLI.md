## Introduction

Hello and welcome to the first lecture of UQ's partnership with Google - the  Developer Student Club initiative. My name is Hamish Bultitude, and today we will be going through the UNIX command line together. This lecture is intended for students that are in first and second year before taking CSSE2310, yet can act as a refresher if you are looking for it!

Note that this is indeed for the UNIX commandline - whilst there is *some* crossover with [windows systems](check), applicability of this lecture includes Linux, macOS and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Check online for info on how to install WSL if you are on windows, or you can login to UQs student computer - *MOSS* via SSH. 

Lets begin!
